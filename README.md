# JumpWalker

A group project for ELEC 390 that involves building a small and simple desktop application that accepts accelerometer
data (x, y, and z axes) in CSV format, and writes the outputs into a separate CSV file. The output
CSV file contains the labels (‘walking’ or ‘jumping’) for the corresponding input data. For
classification purposes, the system will use a simple classifier, i.e., logistic regression.

The app used to collect acceleration data is the "Phyphox" using the accerleration (without g).

Run parts in order for the project to work properly.
